# Project & Portfolio #
## John D. Mack ##

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository was created for the purpose of tracking and maintaining a running showcase of portolio prjects for John Mack.
* This portfolio will showcase all coursework and completed projects for this course and demonstrate my mastery of the material covered at the completion of a Bachelor's in Mobile Development at Full Sail University.
* In addition, this portfolio includes multiple "passion projects" that have been created with the intent of improving upon coding skills and laying the groundwork for apps that will ultimately be publised on the Apple App Store and Google Play.
* This file will be updated regularly as I progress through the current course and will reflect information relevant to my current achievements and completed projects.

### What's Included ##

* All completed projects from Scalable Data Infrastructures, previously completed at Full Sail University.
* Evidence of refractoring on original SDI projects, as required for coursework in Project and Portfolio 1.
* All projects completed as required coursework in Project & Portfolio classes at Full Sail University.
* Multiple "passion projects." **Please Note** _The majority of these passion projects contain issues that must be addressed, as time allows, before being published._

######

	* Mack-John-FindErrorsClasses
	* Mack-John-Find-Errors-Func
	* Mack-John-FindErrorsCond

######
* **Coding Projects** - _Original source code, written based on specified requirements as outlined by course instructor._
	* Mack-John-Array-Lists
	* Mack-John-Arrays
	* Mack-John_Conditionals
	* Mack-John-CountFish
	* Mack-John-CustomClass
	* Mack-John-FinalProject
	* Mack-John-LogicLoops
	* Mack-John-MadLibs
	* Mack-John-Methods
	* Mack-John-RestaurantCalc
	* Mack-John-StringObjects
	
######
* **DVP1.CE1** - _Original source code, written based on specified requirements as outlined in the Project & Portfolio 1_ course.
	* SwapInfo - _Collects first and last name of user and displays that input back to the user.  Using a custom function, reverses the values of variables storing first and last name and displays the reversed values back to the user._
	
	######
	* Backwards - _Prompts user for a sentence containing no fewer than six (6) words.  Using a custom function, reverses the characters in the user's string and reports the reversed string back to the user._
	
	######
	* AgeConvert - _Prompts user for their name and age in years.  The user's age is then passed into multiple custom functions to calculate age in days, hours, minutes and seconds before reporting this information back to the user._
	
	######
	* TempConvert - _Promputs user for a temperature in fareneit, converts that temperature to celcius and reports the results back to the user.  Then the user is prompted for a temperature is celcius, converts to farenheit and reports the results back to the user._
	
	######
	* Menu - _Presents user with a menu to select from the other four coding challenges in this project and runs each external class based on the user's selection._
	
######
* **UI Mockups & Basic Functionality** _Primarily showcases ability to design UIs with mobile users in mind. As the knowledge to create functional mobile apps has not yet been obtained, basic functionality has been simulated in C#._
	* Shoply - _A basic mobile shopping list application. Allows users to add items that they need to purchase to their "Need" list. Once the item has been purchased, the user is able to check the item to have it automatically removed from the "Need" list and added to the "Have" list._
	
	######
	* Contacts - _Simulates a basic mobile contacts application that allows users to create, edit, and delete contact entries._
	
	######
	* TicTacToe - _Simulates a basic Tic Tac Toe game, which allows users to take turns placing their move on the play surface._
    
######
* ** Matchly ** _A simple matching game, complete with animations, sound effects, and theme music. This application includes the game, which supports different grid sizes for different devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.), and a leaderboard that tracks high scores. This applications is a good showcase of visual and user experience design skills._
	
######
* **Keep Calm and Calendar** - _This marks the first fully functional iOS application developed for the purposes of this portfolio. This is also an ongoing passion project that is being developed with parents of children with Autism in mind. When complete, this application will provide users with a platorm to provide children with Autism with a visual representation of their daily activities._

	### Installation Instructions: ###
	In the project's current state, installation is accomplished by running the application in a simulator or side loading directly to a device from Xcode. Upon completion, installation will be possible either via download from the App Store or by running a custom installation APK.
	
	######
	### Hardware Requirements: ###
	* iPhone SE or later
	* iPad 9 or later
	* Wifi or mobile network connection
	* Use of onboard camera
	
	### Login requirements / credentials for testing: ###
	* You may establish a new account if you wish. To do this, you will need to provide an established e-mail address and a valid password (8 characters long and must contain one capital letter and one number, with no special characters.)
	
	######
	* If you do not wish to establish a new account, you may use the provided test account
		* Username/email address: johnnymack1982@gmail.com
		* Password: Car0lina
		
	######
	**NOTE:** All test accounts have been deleted to implement cloud storage functionality. Please establish a new account or use the provided test credentials
	
	######
	### Known Bugs: ###
	The algorithm for removing weekly recurring events that occur in the past without sacrificing future events in the series requires further testing and debugging. Future sprints are less time intensive so this will be worked into the schedule over the next week to address. This is not expected to have an impact on the progress of the rest of the project.
	
	######
	Calendar items sync out of original order when downloading from Firestore. This will require further research to correct.
	
######
* **CrypJoy - Apple Watch Edition** - _This is a "passion project" and a simple "pay it forward" application that provides users with the simple goal of committing a set number of random acts of kindness throughout the day. As users log acts of kindness, their daily score is tallied and visualized on the watch and on a paired iPhone device. In addition, users can record acts of kindness that others have performed for them, increasing their daily goal up to a set daily maximum._
